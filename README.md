CoGetServerPID
==============

I wrote an article years ago [1]. Go read it. This repo contains the accompanying source code.

* CoGetServerPID.h is released under the BSD license, see below.
* uCoGetServerPID.pas was donated by Jon Robertson and is still hosted on the article site, because I don't yet have his permission to re-license it.

For license terms, see LICENSE.
